# Music-recommendation-for-Spotify-user
Introduction
68 percent of Americans report listening to music every day, and music streaming services like Spotify are the primary means people listen to music. As such, there is an enormous and incredibly consistent market for music. Considering how low investment listening to a song is in the era of streaming, people are very willing to try, often looking for, new music. Recommendation systems are critical in todayâ€™s information and product rich world, but they are especially critical to music. With enough music to last a lifetime, a good recommendation system can identify music that a listener is most likely to enjoy. Improving recommendation systems when it comes to music has the potential to improve satisfaction of an enormous number of customers.

Problem statement
Spotify is an audio streaming device that is all about providing audio content to users and keep users active on the app by recommending the next possible music or podcast. Since Spotify has over 286 million active users and about 44% of them use it daily, there is a large amount of data that Spotify analyzes to provide user recommendation. Spotify does a fairly decent job in recommending users music but we believe we can use their dataset and some Machine Learning algorithms to improve the recommendations. 
Objective:
Develop a personalized song list for users based on their past listening history.
Constraints:
Some form of interpretability.
For a given user we need to predict the next song he would like to listen to. The given problem is a Recommendation problem.
